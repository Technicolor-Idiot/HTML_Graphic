    <p>Chances are that you've probably seen the spotted lanternfly hanging around your local parks, buzzing from tree to tree. At first it seems
      unremarkable, with its dusty gray and black polka dots, but your opinion will change when the insect unfurls its wing. Underneath it reveals its scarlet, black-spotted
      hind wings and striking, yellow thorax. It's no wonder that you can look at this beautiful bug and forget that it is one of New York's newest invasive species.
       Originally native to Asia, the spotted lanternfly was first documented in Pennsylvania in 2014.
      It is suspected that the insect was introduced from trade ships unknowingly carrying egg masses on U.S. bound trade ships.
      Part of the insects ability to proliferate quickly is that it is a master hitchhiker, latching on to anything for a ride or laying eggs on any type of material or surface
       from wood, metal, to cloth.

    <p>For the last 7 years, the spotted lanternfly has gone unchecked. With no natural predators or approved insecticides to use on the pest,
       populations have been established in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Kentucky,and New York.
       The first spotted lanternfly in New York City was documented in 2020, and in the ensuing year it has spread to all of the five boroughs.
       The spotted lanternfly is also no picky eater, targetting anything from trees, bushes, to vines. However, its true destructive capabilities might be felt
       in Long Island and the Finger Lakes, with grape vineyards being squarely in the crosshairs.

    <p>Currently, there is no clear path to eradication of this invasive insect. For now, the New York Department of Agriculture
       and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation have asked that if you see anything then take a photo. It can either be of the insect, egg masses, or any signs of possible infestation, and then email
       your findings to <a href="mailto:spottedlanternfly@agriculture.ny.gov">spottedlanternfly@agriculture.ny.gov</a>. And again, they advise that if you see it <b>SQUISH IT.<b>
